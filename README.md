# Control-of-Watt-Straight-Line-Mechanism-using-BondGraph-20sim-
Bond graph is a modern way to get the equation of motion of any mechanism. But also, to animate the movements of this mechanism and deploy difference control techniques on it. This project illustrates the utilization of 20sim and the concept of bond graph in the control of Watt Straight line mechanism.
